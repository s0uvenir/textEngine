# Cooking Simulator
# Added dummy start node so that other nodes cannot reach the true
# start node

# potential issue:
# can get more than one 'dry pancake mix' at a time

# every pre-req matches with a content
# but not every content requires a pre-req

# IE: the first declared pre-req in a node is paired with the first
# declared content in the node

# if there are no pre-reqs, simply add all contents to inventory
# if there are pre-reqs, determine which pre-req(s) are in the
# inventory, remove them, and add the corresponding contents

# at end of game, if there are items in the inventory, they should
# be listed (seperated by commas)
